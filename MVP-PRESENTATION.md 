# MVP Self Evaluation

## Anson He

## Demo Improvements:

- The demo was simple and didn't truly showcase the product as it truly looks or functions.
- I plan to adjust the demo to better represent the core features and give a clearer picture of its value.

## Personal Involvement:

- I was not directly involved in presenting the MVP due to personal circumstances.
- After watching the video, I believe we can improve by shortening the introduction and dedicating more time to showcasing the product's functionality.
Focus on User Perspective:

The presentation was overly technical and missed an opportunity to highlight the product’s features from the user’s perspective.
In future presentations, I will ensure that the demo focuses more on how users interact with and benefit from the product.

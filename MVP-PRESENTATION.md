# MVP Self Evaluation

## `Anson He`

### Demo Improvements

- The demo was simple and didn't truly showcase the product as it truly looks or functions.
- I plan to adjust the demo to better represent the core features and give a clearer picture of its value.

### Personal Involvement

- I was not directly involved in presenting the MVP due to personal circumstances.
- After watching the video, I believe we can improve by shortening the introduction and dedicating more time to showcasing the product's functionality.
  Focus on User Perspective:

The presentation was overly technical and missed an opportunity to highlight the product’s features from the user’s perspective.
In future presentations, I will ensure that the demo focuses more on how users interact with and benefit from the product.

## `Norman Yuan`

### Demo Improvements

- Clarify Features: Some features were not clearly explained. Providing real-world use cases would help the audience understand the product's value.
- Technical Depth: While it's important to keep the presentation accessible, providing a bit more technical depth can showcase the product's robustness.
- Flow: Ensure that the presentation flows logically from problem statement to solution and demonstration.

### Personal Involvement

- Role in Presentation: I was responsible for introducing the main features and guiding the demo.
- Reflections: I noticed that we could have managed our time better to cover all the key points without rushing.
- Future Improvements: I plan to rehearse more thoroughly and gather feedback beforehand to ensure a smooth delivery.


## `Huijia Wang`

### Demo Improvements

- The current demo did not fully reflect the functionality and core value of the product.
- We will further discuss and enhance it by demonstrating the key features more clearly and aligning them with the product’s intended purpose.

### Personal Involvement

- Role in Presentation: I was responsible for providing an overview of the demo, outlining the next steps, and delivering the conclusion.
- Reflections: The overview could have been more engaging, and the next steps clearer.
- Future Focus : I’ll rehearse more to ensure my delivery is smooth and connects well with the rest of the presentation.


## `Yuming Sun`

### Demo Improvements

- We lack some features compared to other groups, but we should focus more on the features we developed and spend more time explaining what makes us different from other groups.

### Personal Involvement

- Role in Presentation: I was responsible for providing an introduction of project, 
- Reflections: I think the content is similar to last time, but this time I should explain it in more detail instead of reading the slige again.
- Future Focus : I should have edited the slide a lot to remove more texts.

# MVP Self Evaluation

## `Anson He`

### Demo Improvements

- The demo was simple and didn't truly showcase the product as it truly looks or functions.
- I plan to adjust the demo to better represent the core features and give a clearer picture of its value.

### Personal Involvement

- I was not directly involved in presenting the MVP due to personal circumstances.
- After watching the video, I believe we can improve by shortening the introduction and dedicating more time to showcasing the product's functionality.
Focus on User Perspective:

The presentation was overly technical and missed an opportunity to highlight the product’s features from the user’s perspective.
In future presentations, I will ensure that the demo focuses more on how users interact with and benefit from the product.

### Demo Improvements

- Clarify Features: Some features were not clearly explained. Providing real-world use cases would help the audience understand the product's value.
- Technical Depth: While it's important to keep the presentation accessible, providing a bit more technical depth can showcase the product's robustness.
- Flow: Ensure that the presentation flows logically from problem statement to solution and demonstration.

### Personal Involvement

- Role in Presentation: I was responsible for introducing the main features and guiding the demo.
- Reflections: I noticed that we could have managed our time better to cover all the key points without rushing.
- Future Improvements: I plan to rehearse more thoroughly and gather feedback beforehand to ensure a smooth delivery.

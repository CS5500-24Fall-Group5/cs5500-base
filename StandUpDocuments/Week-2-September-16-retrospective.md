## Individual Self-Assessments

### `Anson He`

- **Achievements and Contributions:**

  - Analyzed the calc-sheet frontend code, and started the documentation of the analysis.
- **Challenges Faced:**

  - Some part of the React code was hard to understand, such as this demo use url parsing for routing, may be should be using a modern react router.
- **Areas for Improvement:**

  - N/A
- **Feedback and Suggestions:**

  - Spend more time on understanding the code and see how to make it more robust, and start thinking ahead what tools/libraries can be used for our project later on.

### `Norman Yuan`

- **Achievements and Contributions:**
  - Led the analysis of the backend architecture, focusing on RESTful APIs and user management.
  - Analyzed the frontend components, including multi-screen navigation and API integration.
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - Deciphering complex state management without hands-on manipulation.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Investigate more on how state changes are propagated through the frontend.
- **Feedback and Suggestions:**
  - Suggest including a section on best practices for frontend-backend data flow.

### `Huijia Wang`

- **Achievements and Contributions:**
  - Analyzed the backend architecture, focusing on RESTful APIs and user management.
  - Read the project code and analyzed the design patterns in the project, such as **Singleton** for managing document instances,  **Observer** like polling for update checks, and **MVC** for separating concerns in the backend.
- **Challenges Faced:**
  - There is a lot of code to read. And sometimes I may forget some part I have read so I taked note to help me analyze the code.
- **Areas for Improvement:**
  - Spend more time to analyze the fronted code.
- **Feedback and Suggestions:**
  - Discuss with team members about this project and spend more time reading this project.

### `Yuming Sun`

- **Achievements and Contributions:**

  - This week, I reviewed the calsheet document and analyzed the front end. And supplemented the front end part in the analysis document.
- **Challenges Faced:**

  - I did it later this week. At first, I felt very difficult because I missed the class and there were some bugs in the initial operation of the program. Although it was not difficult, it took me some time. Fortunately, I communicated with the team members in time to solve the problem.
- **Areas for Improvement:**

  - I think the biggest point of improvement is that if there is a problem, you need to communicate with the team members in time and coordinate time for meetings. This is helpful for mutual problem solving.
- **Feedback and Suggestions:**

  - It only took me some time to complete the front end part. I hope that next week I will make arrangements in advance and communicate with the team members in time.

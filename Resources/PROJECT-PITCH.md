## What Went Well
- **Clear problem identification**: We effectively communicated the challenges BC Cancer faces with manual donor management, emphasizing inefficiencies and the need for automation.  
- **Innovative solution**: The chosen Donor Lifecycle Management system offers clear benefits through automated categorization and tailored engagement, which was well-received during the presentation.  
- **Live demo success**: Our demo showcased the donor lifecycle app's key features, such as filtering donors by lifecycle stage, adding new donors, and editing records, providing the audience with a hands-on understanding of the projectâ€™s impact.

## What Would We Do Better Next Time
- **Improve presentation flow**: Some sections could have been more cohesive to ensure smoother transitions between speakers, which would make our message clearer.  
- **Anticipate challenges better**: We should have addressed potential risks earlier in the presentation, such as the automated categorization's accuracy limitations, and how we plan to mitigate them.  
- **Time management**: We need to allocate time more evenly to ensure every aspect of the project, including technical stack details, receives adequate attention without rushing through any part.

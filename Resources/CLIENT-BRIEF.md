# High-Level Description of the Problem

## Product Brief (What & Why)

### Overview

This project aims to streamline BC Cancer's fundraising operations by automating data handling processes, reducing reliance on manual Excel-based workflows, and integrating a seamless feedback loop into the existing Raiser’s Edge CRM system. The goal is to create an efficient, data-driven solution to enhance donor engagement, event planning, and operational workflow.

### Background & Context

#### Problem

BC Cancer’s fundraising operations face inefficiencies due to manual data handling, fragmented information, and poor integration with their CRM system, Raiser’s Edge. Fundraisers extract donor data into Excel sheets for event planning and communications, leading to errors, inefficiencies, and a lack of personalization.

#### Challenge

Key pain points identified include:

1. **Manual Data Handling**: Fundraisers frequently extract lists of donors and invitees from Raiser’s Edge into Excel, which is often slow, cumbersome, and prone to errors. These lists are used for event planning and donor communications but lack feedback loops to update the system automatically, resulting in repetitive tasks and inefficiencies.
2. **Fragmented Information and Lack of Integration**: Different fundraising events focus on specific areas (e.g., regional events or disease-specific support), requiring multiple customized lists of invitees. The current process involves manually pulling and compiling data, which is disconnected across various systems and platforms. There is no seamless way to integrate insights back into the CRM, causing operational friction and repetitive manual checks.
3. **Data Mismatch and Usability Issues**: The data compiled from Raiser’s Edge is often incomplete, mismatched, or overly complex, making it difficult for fundraisers to quickly identify key relationships and make informed decisions. Fundraisers struggle to look up the specific areas in which donors are involved, which complicates event planning and targeted communication. The system does not learn or adapt from previous actions, leading to repeated manual reviews and decisions that slow down the process.
4. **Inconsistent Donor Engagement**: The process of engaging with donors lacks consistency due to the manual nature of sorting and personalizing invitations and communications. Fundraisers spend a significant amount of time reviewing and selecting donors for specific events, often missing opportunities or duplicating efforts because of outdated or incomplete data. Challenges include sending incorrect invitations and manually excluding or including donors based on outdated or disconnected information.

## Objectives

The goal is to automate and improve BC Cancer's fundraising processes by enhancing data management, reducing manual work, and integrating systems for more efficient donor engagement.

1. **Automated Donor List Creation**: Replace manual extraction and sorting of donor lists with an automated system.
2. **Integrated Feedback Loop**: Create a system where donor engagement outcomes are automatically updated(Manual reasonings), allowing fundraisers to adjust future actions based on past behaviors.
3. **Improve data integration**：Ensure smooth data flow between CRM and event systems for better coordination.
4. **Streamlined Event Planning**: Enable fundraisers to generate targeted donor lists quickly based on involvement in specific areas (e.g., regional events, disease-specific support) and reduce repetitive tasks.
5. **Enhanced Reporting & Tracking**: Implement a tracking system that enables managers to monitor event planning and donor engagement progress visually and in real-time.

BC Cancer seeks a more automated, integrated, and data-driven approach to streamline their fundraising operations, reduce manual workload, and enhance overall donor engagement. The goal is to develop a proof of concept that demonstrates how improved data integration, smarter workflows, and an enhanced review list process can better support their strategic fundraising efforts.

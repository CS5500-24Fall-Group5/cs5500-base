# High-Level Description of the Problem

BC Cancer’s fundraising operations face significant challenges related to data management, manual processes, and integration inefficiencies, with a critical issue being the review list process. Currently, data from Raiser’s Edge, the main CRM system, is pulled into Excel spreadsheets, leading to a range of complications. This method results in ineffective donor communication, difficulty identifying donors' specific involvement areas (e.g., prostate cancer vs. breast cancer), and overall inefficiencies in the fundraising workflow.

Key pain points identified include:

1. **Manual Data Handling**: Fundraisers frequently extract lists of donors and invitees from Raiser’s Edge into Excel, which is often slow, cumbersome, and prone to errors. These lists are used for event planning and donor communications but lack feedback loops to update the system automatically, resulting in repetitive tasks and inefficiencies.

2. **Fragmented Information and Lack of Integration**: Different fundraising events focus on specific areas (e.g., regional events or disease-specific support), requiring multiple customized lists of invitees. The current process involves manually pulling and compiling data, which is disconnected across various systems and platforms. There is no seamless way to integrate insights back into the CRM, causing operational friction and repetitive manual checks.

3. **Data Mismatch and Usability Issues**: The data compiled from Raiser’s Edge is often incomplete, mismatched, or overly complex, making it difficult for fundraisers to quickly identify key relationships and make informed decisions. Fundraisers struggle to look up the specific areas in which donors are involved, which complicates event planning and targeted communication. The system does not learn or adapt from previous actions, leading to repeated manual reviews and decisions that slow down the process.

4. **Inconsistent Donor Engagement**: The process of engaging with donors lacks consistency due to the manual nature of sorting and personalizing invitations and communications. Fundraisers spend a significant amount of time reviewing and selecting donors for specific events, often missing opportunities or duplicating efforts because of outdated or incomplete data. Challenges include sending incorrect invitations and manually excluding or including donors based on outdated or disconnected information.

BC Cancer seeks a more automated, integrated, and data-driven approach to streamline their fundraising operations, reduce manual workload, and enhance overall donor engagement. The goal is to develop a proof of concept that demonstrates how improved data integration, smarter workflows, and an enhanced review list process can better support their strategic fundraising efforts.
